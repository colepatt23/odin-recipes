    <h3>Perpperoni Pizza</h3>
    <p>This is what your pepperoni pizza should look like at the end. Hopefully.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Roni</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pepperoni pizza is quite simple to make once you have the dough. 
        Go buy some dough at your local pizzeria so that you don't have to waste
        any time making it yourself. Or make it yourself, I dont care.
        </li>
        <li>After you've got dough you need to roll it out into a circle. 
        You can do this with a rolloing pin easily. Make sure to use plenty
        of flour. If you want to get fancy with it you can use only your hands 
        and start spinning and throwing the dough in the air to stretch it. But,
        let's be honest you're not that guy and you'll probably just end up making a mess
        of your kitchen.
        </li>
        <li>Once the dough is rolled out into a cirlce spread your sauce using a ladle 
        starting in the middle and moving outwards in a circle.
        Then add your shredded cheese and pepperoni on top. 
        Put in the oven at 4:25 for 20 minutes or whenever it's ready.
        </li>
    </ol>
