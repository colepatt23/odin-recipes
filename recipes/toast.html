    <h3>Toast</h3>
    <p>This is toast, it's really just twice baked bread but it's good this way so make it.
        No, we will not be making french toast today. Just regular toast.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Whatever toppings you want</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your bread and put it in the toaster. If you don't have one put it in a hot pan 
            and cook both sides for a couple minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Toast is really simple I don't know why you're even looking this up

        </li>
        <li>Once the bread is golden brown take the toast and put whatever toppings you want on it
            I like butter or peanut butter. 
        </li>
    </ol>
